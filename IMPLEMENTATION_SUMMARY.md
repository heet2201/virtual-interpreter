```python
from virtual_interpreter.advanced import create_advanced_asr, create_advanced_translator

# Fine-tunable components
asr = create_advanced_asr(enable_fine_tuning=True)
translator = create_advanced_translator(enable_domain_adaptation=True)

# Custom training on domain data
asr.fine_tune(train_dataset, val_dataset, output_dir="./custom_asr")
translator.fine_tune(translation_data, domains=["medical", "legal"])
```
